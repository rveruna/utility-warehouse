# Claims Form â€“ React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is a simple React + TypeScript frontend powered by Vite. It includes a form to submit claims (date, category, and description) with submission handled via a Node.js API route.

**Features**:

- React 19 with TypeScript and Vite
- `@tanstack/react-query` for mutation handling
- Form validation with native browser features
- Fully tested using Jest and Testing Library
- Logs claim data to a local `claims.log` file

## ðŸ”ª Testing

We use **Jest** with `ts-jest` for unit tests and React Testing Library for interaction tests.

All form behaviors are tested: valid submission, field validation, error handling, and async state handling.
